Rails Webscraping application - done in the spirit of curiousity.

I was previously tasked with creating a webscraper script in Ruby and decided to build one in a Rails App.
This app is designed to scrape rent info from the webpage of craigslist in a particular city inputted by the user.
The city info is hard-coded in the app however that can be adjusted.
